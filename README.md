## Project Overview

For example: Your machine stopped working, so you have this repository that will help you install the basics 
for putting you back in track in no time.
This will be a series of files anf configuration that will help anyone that find it useful to start with minimal search.

## Getting Started

For the moment there are two files.

- The [InitalScript.sh](scripts/InitialScript.sh), is a bash file that contains all the installations of packages and tools to put the machine in good use. (It is intended for a DevOps programmer thought).
- The [.bash_aliases](scripts/.bash_aliases), is a bash configuration file that contains some aliases that I use every day.
